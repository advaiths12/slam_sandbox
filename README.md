### SLAM Sandbox
These files are needed for experimentation and visualization of functions intended for a pose-graph based SLAM system. 
Generally, they provide interfaces for quaternion conversion, frame visualization, etc. 
It is helpful in MATLAB to be able to generate Jacobians for any of these functions so they are created with the intent to be symbolically differentiable
